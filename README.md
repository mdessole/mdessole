# Monica Dessole, PhD

## Projects 💻🚀

- I'm currently working on speeding up the [ROOT library](https://github.com/root-project/root) by leveraging on GPGPUs
- as part of the [SYCLOPS project](https://www.syclops.org), I develop sustainable and multi-platform data analytic frameworks via SYCL 
- most of my past work consisted in designing and implementing high-performance linear algebra core operations, such as QR decomposition for rank deficient matrices, least squares minimizers for quadratic problems with contraints, and parallel preconditioning techniques for CFD problems

## Languages and tools 🛠️

C • C++ • Python • CUDA • SYCL • [perf](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page)
